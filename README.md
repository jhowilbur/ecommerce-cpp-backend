# ECommerceSystem

## Description

ECommerceSystem is a C++ project simulating an online shopping platform. 
It models users, products, orders, payments, and other related entities, 
following the principles of object-oriented design. 
This project is designed to demonstrate clean code practices and efficient project organization in C++.

## Features

- Object-Oriented Design
- Simulation of E-Commerce Operations
- Clean Code Practices
- Well-structured Project Folders

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
